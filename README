This is a modified version of the Samsung Galaxy S's FMRadio.apk.

The stock FMRadio.apk supports three regions but it is restrained from displaying the third (Japan).

This unlocks "Japan" which supports a different frequency range.

USA 87.5MHz - 108MHz
Europe 87.5MHz - 108MHz
Japan 76MHz -108MHz
